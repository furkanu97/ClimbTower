ClimbTower is a hypercasual game which I have designed with help of my mentor during my internship.
Then I have started to develop as my semester begins. I could not finish the game development during my internship
so I have decided to finish developing during my semester.

I have added data persistence to track down the process informations of the players.

Note: I have added a login screen which checks the BigQuery database using Google Functions and not letting the banned players in.
      It was a very simple system but I have changed it back since I could not be able to keep my database running all the time.
      Code for this login process can be reviewed as comments in Assets/Scripts/LoginScreen.cs file.
      Also, code for the server side of the login process can be reviewed in ClimbTower_Google_Cloud folder.
      
Special thanks to no-pact.
